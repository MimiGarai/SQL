# For this project, I downloaded a dataset called chinook from BreakIntoTech.Teachable.com, which represents a digital media store 
  # and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.
# I performed the below analytics on the data using complex SQL including multiple joins, subqueries, and filtering messy data.

The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country. */
